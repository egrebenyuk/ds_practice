## Installation

---

Please, follow the installation instructions below. If your installation is not complete or if you have any problems, come to meetup and we will help you with installation!
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Install Python</a>
    <br>Note: We use Python 2.7.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Install Anaconda</a>
  <br>Note: We are using <a href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a> for our research. If you're using OS X or Windows, we recommend you download and install Anaconda, which is a free bundled installer of Python together with many other useful tools (including IPython Notebook.)
