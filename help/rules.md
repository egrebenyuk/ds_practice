## Rules

---

We use <a href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a> for our research. Check out <a href="/help/install.md">installation instructions</a> and <a href="/resources/online_python.md">great online resources for beginners</a> if you are new to Python.
<p>Choose project or data set that you would like to work on and feel free to add new IPython Notebook to appropriate folder, but please, try to include research that wasn't submitted already by someone else. Add notebooks with new data exploratory, modelling or interesting visual content. Please, do not duplicate notebooks. Otherwise I will reject your pull request.
