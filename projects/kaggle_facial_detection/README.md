### Detect the location of keypoints on face images

The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:
<ul>
  <li>tracking faces in images and video</li>
  <li>analysing facial expressions</li>
  <li>detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis</li>
  <li>biometrics / face recognition</li>
</ul>

<p>Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem. Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.
